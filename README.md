# Twitter Rap Battle Generator

This project is an app that generates rap battles between two Twitter users based on their tweets, drawing on tweets uploaded to the [Community Archive](https://www.community-archive.org/).

Created during the 2025 Community Archive Hackathon at [Fractal Tech](https://fractaltechhub.com/). 

Currently running on Priya's private Claude credits -- support the project by Venmoing @Priya-Ghose.

## Features

- Fetches user data and tweets from the [Community Archive](https://www.community-archive.org/).
- Generates rap lyrics using the Claude API.
- Displays the rap battle with styled text for each user.

## TODO 
- Find way to connect more directly with Suno (no API but unofficial one here: https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Ability to search through dropdown menus more easily
- Cool loading graphics while generating is happening
- Give more precise error messages (e.g. is it failing because low money in Claude account?)
- Ability to vote on who wins the rap battle
- Use community data to detect current beefs and auto-generate raps
- Twitter bot that tweets out all generated raps
- Update UI so it displays both people's profile pics
